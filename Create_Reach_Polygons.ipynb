    "# Create reach polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code takes a river polyline shapefile extracted from the HydroAtlas HydroRIVERS database, and splits it into reaches that are scaled based on a linear relationship between upstream drainage area and reach length, meaning that reaches become progressively longer downstream. This relationship was deduced by examining upstream drainage area estimates at specific points along the Ganges River in India and manually measuring the width of an ideal reach at that point. Finally, buffers are applied to each reach line to create a polygon encompassing the entire reach, which is used in a subsequent script to extract river masks from that area. \n",
