    "# Calculate river planform (sinuosity, channel count index, channel form index)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is directed to a given local path containing 2-D water mask rasters. The code takes the water mask, and start by creating a \"skeleton\" of the mask. It then dilates the tips of the skeleton to improve connection of the channel network, reskeletonizes, and reduces the skeleton to only the identifiable river channels. From the final skeletion, channel links and nodes are created. The links are filtered according to criteria, and a shortest path line or \"main channel\" is extracted, along with a simplified main channel which acts as a valley center line, enabling sinuosity calculations. Finally, cross sections of the river are created and channel count index is calculated across the cross-sections. With sinuosity and channel-count index, the chanel form index can be calculated. These river metrics are provided and exported to a .csv. The processed skeleton, nodes, channel links, main channel, valley center-line, and channel-belt cross-sections are output as shapefiles, and the network for each reach/year is plotted and compiled in a PDF for the user' to QA/QC.\n",
