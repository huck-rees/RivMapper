    "# Extract river segements from HydroRIVERS\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code takes a continental-scale rivers shapefile from the HydroATLAS \"HydroRIVERS\" database, which is a large polyline file containing segments of all large rivers in the world. The user should first open the shpaefile in a GIS and find the desired river to extract. The user should then choose the most upstream segment they want for the extraction, and record the 'HYRIV_ID' for that segment. 'HYRIV_ID' is a unique numeric for each segment in the dataset. The user then enters the desired dataset name, path, the 'HYRIV_ID', a river name, and an output path (optional). Executing the code extracts all river segments downstream of and including the given 'HYRIV_ID' segment, terminating at the ocean or depositional basin. This is written as a shapefile to the desired output folder and named after the river.\n",
