    "# Extract river segements from HydroRIVERS\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code takes a continental-scale rivers shapefile from the HydroATLAS \"HydroRIVERS\" database, which is a large polyline file containing segments of all large rivers in the world. The HydroRIVERS shapefiles should already be downloaded to your working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user should first open the HydroRIVERS shapefile for the desired continent in a GIS and find the desired river to extract. The user should then choose the most upstream segment they want for the extraction, and record the 'HYRIV_ID' for that segment. 'HYRIV_ID' is a unique numeric for each segment in the dataset. Using a standard \"RivMapper\" .csv input sheet, the user then enters the desired river name (river_name), the working directory, the upstream and downstream segments via the HYRIV_IDs (us_hyriv_id and ds_hyriv_id), the ending condition either as \"specific_segment\" or \"length\" (end_condition), the maximum river channel length to extract if the end condition is length (max_length_km). Then, within this notebook, the user must simply enter the path to their RivMapper input sheet, and run. Executing the code extracts all river segments downstream of and including the given 'HYRIV_ID' segment, terminating at the ocean or depositional basin. This is written as a shapefile to the desired output folder and named after the river.\n",
